## How to start the app as service
```sublime-commands
#!/bin/sh
SERVICE_NAME=liteP2PBox
PATH_TO_JAR=$JAR_PATH/p2p.jar
PID_PATH_NAME=/tmp/liteP2PBox-pid
case $1 in
    start)
        echo "Starting $SERVICE_NAME ..."
        if [ ! -f $PID_PATH_NAME ]; then
            nohup $JAVA_8_PATH/java -jar $PATH_TO_JAR /tmp 2>> /dev/null >> /dev/null &
                        echo $! > $PID_PATH_NAME
            echo "$SERVICE_NAME started ..."
        else
            echo "$SERVICE_NAME is already running ..."
        fi
    ;;
    stop)
        if [ -f $PID_PATH_NAME ]; then
            PID=$(cat $PID_PATH_NAME);
            echo "$SERVICE_NAME stoping ..."
            kill $PID;
            echo "$SERVICE_NAME stopped ..."
            rm $PID_PATH_NAME
        else
            echo "$SERVICE_NAME is not running ..."
        fi
    ;;
    restart)
        if [ -f $PID_PATH_NAME ]; then
            PID=$(cat $PID_PATH_NAME);
            echo "$SERVICE_NAME stopping ...";
            kill $PID;
            echo "$SERVICE_NAME stopped ...";
            rm $PID_PATH_NAME
            echo "$SERVICE_NAME starting ..."
            nohup $JAVA_8_PATH/java -jar $PATH_TO_JAR /tmp 2>> /dev/null >> /dev/null &
                        echo $! > $PID_PATH_NAME
            echo "$SERVICE_NAME started ..."
        else
            echo "$SERVICE_NAME is not running ..."
        fi
    ;;
esac
```
Edit the service file:
- Replace $JAVA_8_PATH with corresponding pat for Java 8.
- Replace $JAR_PATH with corresponding path for the runnable jar.

Execute command in terminal to move the script at the services folder:
`mv ./service /etc/init.d/liteP2Pbox`

`cd /etc/init.d/`

`chmod +x liteP2Pbox`

Start app as service:
`sudo service liteP2Pbox start`

Stop service:
`sudo service liteP2Pbox stop`
